# Reservation Request
One of the JS projects I did at college. Launching the reservation.html file leads to a 3-tab page that has the user fill out various info for reserving a hotel room.
There's several validators that check to make sure all information has been filled out and in the proper format or else the submit button won't work. Successful form completion leads to a separate page.
